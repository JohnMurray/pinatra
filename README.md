# Pinatra

If the name of this project isn't enough to let you know what it is, this is a
Sinatra clone in PHP. Currently this is not a serious project, just a little
something for me to try and learn a little more about PHP. 

My background is
mainly in Ruby and I have a strong love for Sinatra. So, I'm taking about the
task to implement the basic feature-set that is present in Sinatra. Mainly
the minimalistic route matching and hooks that Sinatra exposes for whipping
up dandy little web-apps/api's very quickly.


## On the Calendar

The items that I will be adding/implementing next are (roughly) as follows:

+ Parametric URIs (variables actually passed to the handler functions)
+ Configuration blocks
+ Testing before and after hooks
+ POST functionality
+ DELETE functionality
+ HEAD functionality
+ Ability to embed instances within each other (like Rack-apps)
